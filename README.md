# 🕶️ Blackout Protocol: Mr. Robot Edition

**Blackout Protocol** is an interactive, browser-based hacking simulation inspired by the world of *Mr. Robot*.  
You play as **Elliot Gray**, a rogue hacker recruited by *fsociety* to infiltrate the systems of the corrupt conglomerate **E Corp** and prevent a catastrophic blackout before midnight.

This immersive experience guides you through stealthy intrusions, logic puzzles, network exploits, and cyber deception — all wrapped in a retro terminal-style interface.  
Every decision you make can either bring you closer to disabling the blackout protocol… or result in mission failure.
